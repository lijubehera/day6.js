*#Day6 of My JavaScript Learning Journey – Understanding Unary Operators ➕➖**

Today, I explored **Unary Operators** in JavaScript — small but powerful tools used to manipulate single values. This concept plays a big role in expressions and logic building!

---

### ✅ What I Practiced:

🔹 **Unary Plus (`+`)**
Converts a variable into a number.

```javascript
let x = "5";
console.log(+x);  // Output: 5 (converted to number)
```

🔹 **Unary Minus (`-`)**
Negates a number.

```javascript
let y = 3;
console.log(-y);  // Output: -3
```

🔹 **Increment (`++`)**
Increases value by 1.

```javascript
let a = 5;
a++;
console.log(a);  // Output: 6
```

🔹 **Decrement (`--`)**
Decreases value by 1.

```javascript
let b = 10;
b--;
console.log(b);  // Output: 9
```

---

### 👨‍💻 Bonus Code Snippet from My Practice:

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 2;

console.log("a = ", a, " & b = ", b);

a = a + 1;
console.log(a);  // Output: 6
```

📘 It’s fascinating how these simple operators can control complex logic and flow in programs.
